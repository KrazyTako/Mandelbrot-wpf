# Mandelbrot-wpf

Hover over the area you want to zoom in on the Mandlebrot set, then scroll to zoom in or out.
Drag click with the mouse to pan around. Find something interesting and save the image!
Looks best when ran in full screen. Build and run it in release mode for best performance.

This was based off a homework assignment in the Fall of 2016 where we had to render the Mandlebrot set using Win Forms.

I have since rewritten the project in WPF and updated it to do faster image rendering using parallel bitmap manipulation.
I also added UI controls such as the zoom adjustment level bar, render time, and image save.
